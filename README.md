# WeatherFlow-Gauges

Drive a set of analog gauges from the UDP broadcast reports from a WeatherFlow Tempest weather station, using an ESP32 microcontroller.  Current gauges are for Wind Speed (MPH), Wind Direction (cardinal heading), and Temperature (degrees F).  The wind direction assumes there will be 8 LEDs, driven from an SPI output register.
